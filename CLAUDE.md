- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Where possible, structure pieces of logic in libraries that can be tested indivdiually
- Write unit tests verifying changes where possible. It's only okay to skip tests for cross-functional integration behavior, visual state, or any other areas where testing isn't worth the value it provides
- Run tests in affected areas when making a series of code changes.
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Commit changes when it's clear I'm happy with the changes before starting on a new set of changes. Feel free to ask me if I'm ready to commit if it's not already clear
- Ask me to confirm before taking system-level actions or any other things that would be difficult to recover from
